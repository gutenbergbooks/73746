<p><i>Dear Readers</i>:</p>

<p>This little story has been written,
to show you how often we
are the cause of our own unhappiness
by selfish conduct. To
be happy, we should act kindly
towards all who are worthy,
(knowing good conduct more
frequently commands respect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
than riches,) and not permit
ourselves to feel envious of those
who excel us in any way; but
should rather strive to imitate
their good actions, that we may
thus, by correcting our faults,
gain the love of those around
us; ever bearing in mind, that
“to be happy, we must be good.”</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">“I</span> SUPPOSE
you will be at
Miss Rosalba
Pearson’s party
to-morrow
night,” said Isabella
Ingersol
to Matilda
Hamilton, as they sat on the
first resting-place of the steps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
leading up to the reservoir at
Fairmount.</p>

<p>“No, I shall not be there,”
returned Matilda in a contemptuous
tone; “Rosalba Pearson
is no acquaintance of mine.”</p>

<p>“I thought you went to the
same school together.”</p>

<p>“So we do; but that is no
reason that we should be acquainted.
I never spoke to her
in my life, except in such a manner
as one is obliged, sometimes,
to speak to a girl that is in the
same class.”</p>

<p>“She seems, in general, to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
a great favourite in the school,”
said Isabella; “I have often
heard her spoken of with much
affection by many of the girls.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so,” replied her
companion; “but however good
and sweet she may be, she is
certainly not a proper acquaintance
for me.”</p>

<p>“Why not? what is there
amiss about her? I never heard
any one say anything against
her. On the contrary, she is
universally loved and admired.”</p>

<p>“Ma is very particular about
the acquaintances I form at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
school; for she says, it would be
a very awkward thing to have
to shake them off as I grow up.”</p>

<p>“But if you find them amiable
and pleasant acquaintances, I
cannot see why you need shake
them off. For my part, I should
be delighted to think that the
friendships I form while a girl
would last me through life.”</p>

<p>“That would be pleasant
enough, provided they were suitable.
But how would you feel
if in a public assembly you were
accosted familiarly by the daughter
of a storekeeper?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>“If she were one that I admired
and esteemed, I should
not care what her father was,”
replied Isabella with energy.</p>

<p>“So you think at present, because
you find it very pleasant
to go to Rosalba’s party; but
wait a year or two, and see if
you do not acknowledge that
you are sorry your mother allowed
you to form an acquaintance
with girls who did not belong
to the first circles.”</p>

<p>“I have heard Papa say, he
considered Mr. Pearson equal
to any man in Philadelphia, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
integrity, benevolence, and information.”</p>

<p>“That may be very true; but
still he never can belong to the
first circles, you know.”</p>

<p>“Is there any thing that ought
to be placed higher than virtue
and knowledge?” asked Isabella
with great simplicity. “I
have always been taught to
think that these were the criterion
by which we ought to judge
our friends.”</p>

<p>“We may respect a person
or otherwise, in proportion as
he possesses these qualities; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
that is no reason that we should
admit him as an intimate friend.
People of an inferior class,
Mamma says, are so much disposed
to take advantage of any
little kindness that is shown
them, that it is difficult to keep
them at a proper distance.”</p>

<p>“Has Rosalba Pearson ever
shown any disposition to obtrude
herself upon you?”</p>

<p>“No, not at all. I must do
her the justice to say, that she
has always behaved as if she
knew her place.”</p>

<p>“Or that she had no wish to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
force herself into the first circles
unsolicited;” said Isabella dryly.
A slight flush passed over her
companion’s cheek; for she had
too much sense not to understand
what Isabella meant.</p>

<p>“Both Ma and Pa have always
been very particular in
cautioning me against allowing
myself to be drawn into low
company,” said she, as if wishing
to offer an excuse for what
she could not vindicate.</p>

<p>“My parents have been equally
particular,” returned her companion.
“But perhaps your parents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
and mine do not agree as
to what is low company. Some
people judge of individuals according
to their standing in the
world; others by their manners
and information, and consider
them low or high in proportion
to their excellence in these respects.
But it is a subject on
which it is folly for us to pretend
to dispute. All that I
know” she continued playfully,
“is, that unless we sink a little
lower by going down these steps
pretty quickly, we shall be in
danger of having to walk, instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
of riding, home; for I see
your Mamma and my Aunt
Harriet going towards the carriage.”</p>

<p>So saying, Isabella, evidently
desirous of putting a stop to a
conversation in which she saw
plainly they could not agree,
began to run down the steps at
a rapid rate.</p>

<p>“Oh, do stop, Isabella; don’t
run so fast, I beg of you! It’s
so vulgar to run!” exclaimed
Matilda, following as rapidly as
her dignity would permit.</p>

<p>“If I were in Chestnut street,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
it might be so,” replied Isabella,
stopping for a moment at one
of the landings; “but here in
the country, I may surely indulge
myself; and I do, in my
heart, like a good run;” and away
she flew again, nor stopped an
instant till she had reached the
carriage, where, with her sweet
face glowing and her bosom
heaving with the exercise she
had taken, she waited for the
arrival of her more dignified
companion.</p>

<p>“It’s a pity but you could
keep that colour captive, Isabella<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
until to-morrow evening,” said
her Aunt as she looked with
pleasure on the bright face of
her niece. “You would need
little else to prepare you for the
party.”</p>

<p>“What party is she going to?”
asked Mrs. Hamilton, rather surprised
that there was anything
of the kind going on, without
her daughter receiving an invitation.</p>

<p>“Rosalba Pearson’s,” replied
the lady interrogated.</p>

<p>“Oh!” returned Mrs. Hamilton,
in a tone that said as plainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
as words could have spoken
it, “she is welcome to all such
parties.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever spend a more
delightful evening than we had
at Rosalba’s?” asked the occupant
of the desk immediately
behind Matilda’s, to the companion
who shared it with her, the
morning but one after the conversation
we have recorded.</p>

<p>“No, never. Everything went
off so pleasantly! I never saw a
party better conducted. And
yet it was very large.”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” thought Matilda,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
as she commented in her own
mind upon what she heard; “for
amongst the set that was likely
to be there, a party is too great
an event, for them not to flock
to it.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t Charles Lisle and
Rosalba dance the polka beautifully
together?” resumed the
first speaker.</p>

<p>“Charles Lisle!” thought Matilda,
“is it possible he could
condescend to go there! But I
suppose Rosalba’s brother goes
to the same school. Besides, it
is not of so much consequence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
for a boy to form such acquaintances.
Men can associate with
whom they please, without compromising
their dignity, Ma
says.”</p>

<p>Again her ears were arrested,
for the one who had been first
addressed, said in reply; “I
don’t think Henrietta Lisle
danced so well as Rosalba did,
though she certainly had a splendid
partner. Did you ever see
a handsomer boy than Edd
Wharton? And didn’t his sister
look lovely too?”</p>

<p>Matilda was thunder-struck!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Henrietta Lisle at a party given
by Rosalba Pearson! a storekeeper’s
daughter! And Edd
Wharton, too, her paragon of
all that was genteel and elegant,
both as regarded person, fortune,
and family, and his beautiful
sister, to be there!</p>

<p>She was sur-prised and shocked
beyond measure. “But Ma
says, people have latterly got
some very strange notions into
their heads about equality,”
thought she; and at this moment,
to her no small relief, she heard
her class called up; for all that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
had been said of this party was
gall and bitterness to her.</p>

<p>As the season was nearly over,
all who wished to see their
friends were anxious to do so
before the weather became too
warm for such amusements. Of
this number was Isabella Ingersol;
and Matilda, of course, received
a card of invitation.
Though delighted at the thought
of the visit, her pleasure was
somewhat damped, when she
recollected that Rosalba Pearson
must of course be one of the
party. It is true she had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
reason to fear that Rosalba
would in any way force herself
upon her notice; but still there
was a something about this girl
that she half feared, half envied.
That this was so, she certainly
would not have acknowledged,
though she frequently found herself
arguing against it, as if it
was a fact that she could not
wholy deny. That she should
ever for a moment look upon
Rosalba as a rival, was altogether
unaccountable. It was
true they were school-mates, and
might be said to be of the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
age, for they were both in their
thirteenth year; but then Rosalba
was much smaller, and
much more childish looking.
And as to beauty, there could
not be any comparison, for she
had never heard that young lady’s
warmest admirers pretend
to say she was handsome, though
all declared she had a remarkably
sweet countenance; whilst
on the other hand it required
no great stretch of vanity, in her,
to say she knew herself to be so;
for the fact had been acknowledged
by those with whom she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
was well assured she was not a
favourite. Neither could Rosalba
cope with her in respect
to acquirements; for every teacher
she had declared her to be
his best scholar.</p>

<p>Why then should she feel
anything like rivalry towards
this young girl, whose unassuming
manners she could not
herself refuse to acknowledge?
Mr. Pearson was not only a
storekeeper, but had never testified
any desire to step beyond
his calling, and had often been
heard to say, that he was determined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
to give his children the
best education he could, as that
would be the chief thing they
would have to depend upon,
and as it was a fortune that
could not be taken away from
them, he considered it the best
investment for his money. How
different, then, was a girl so situated
from herself, the only child
of one of the richest men in the
city, whose wealth had descended
to him by inheritance, and
who of course belonged to one
of the oldest families in the
State!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>Still, after all this arguing,
Matilda was conscious that
there was something about Rosalba
Pearson of which she was
afraid; and consequently, on entering
her friend Isabella’s ballroom,
felt extreme mortification,
when the first object that met
her view was Edd Wharton
promenading, with Henrietta
Lisle holding by one arm and
Rosalba Pearson the other. It
was to no purpose that she was
received by Isabella and her
mother with the utmost cordiality
and kindness, the former not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
leaving her side till she saw her
engaged with a number of her
particular friends: the cankerworm
of jealousy had found its
way into the unhappy girl’s
heart, and poisoned every better
feeling. In vain she compared
her own splendid dress, and the
costly jewelry with which she
was adorned, with the simple
but conspicuously graceful attire
of her unconscious rival,
who, in all the innocent simplicity
of her heart, sent her merry
laugh to the ears of the writhing
Matilda.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>At length, the musicians took
their places, and the dancing
commenced. Charles Lisle had
already engaged her for the
first set, and at any other time
Matilda would have been highly
satisfied with her partner;
but in the same quadrille, opposite
to her, stood Rosalba by
the side of Edd Wharton, who
talked and laughed with her
with the utmost cordiality. This
was sufficient to destroy all Matilda’s
enjoyment, and she moved
through the dance with even less
than her usual animation, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
she was always careful to avoid
any appearance of enjoying herself,
as being altogether unfashionable
and vulgar. Rosalba,
on the contrary, danced as if
she did so for the pleasure of
the thing; and though her movements
were at all times easy and
graceful, she evidently thought
of the amusement alone, and allowed
herself to be happy without
considering how she looked
whilst she was so.</p>

<p>A succession of partners, such
as Matilda could not find the
slightest fault with, engaged her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
for each succeeding dance, so
that she had not the least cause
to complain of being neglected;
but the only one that she had
set her heart upon dancing with,
never came to ask her. Edmund
Wharton not only belonged
to what Matilda termed the
first circles, but he was the oldest
and by much the handsomest
boy in the room. She knew
also that his talents were far
beyond the ordinary standard,
and that he was remarkably intelligent
and manly for his age.
On these accounts she deemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
herself the most fitting companion
to whom he could have attached
himself for the evening.
But instead of such a selection,
he had only noticed her when
they had met in the first dance,
with a familiar “How d’ye do,
Tilly?” without evincing the
least disposition to come near
her afterwards, whilst he frequently
joined the various
groups of which Rosalba Pearson
formed a part.</p>

<p>At length, the musicians retired
for a time, and refreshments
were brought in, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
which the piano was opened,
and Isabella led the way for
other more skilful performers,
by playing a simple piece, which
having done she called upon
Matilda to take her place. After
some few objections, Matilda
complied, and played a sonata
of considerable difficulty, with
great neatness and execution;
but her touch was hard, and her
style altogether was skilful but
cold. As she rose from the instrument,
all expressed admiration
at the ease with which she
executed exceedingly difficult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
passages; but no one seemed to
be anxious to retain her at her
place.</p>

<p>In a minute or two afterwards,
she heard Rosalba, who stood
near, say, as if in reply to some
request that young Wharton
had made, “Oh, I could not
think of it, after the music we
have just been listening to;” and
being convinced by the tone of
her voice that Rosalba was really
alarmed at the idea of playing
after her, Matilda immediately
determined that she should
do so, and for the first time that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
evening felt something like pleasure,
when she thought of the
difference that Edmund, who
was himself a good musician,
would discover between their
performances.</p>

<p>“I should not have ventured
to sit down to the instrument,”
said she, “if I had not hoped by
that means to secure the pleasure
of hearing Miss Pearson
play.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know I don’t pretend
to be anything of a musician,”
said Rosalba, with unaffected
earnestness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“You only want to surprise
us;” said the haughty girl, endeavouring
for once to put on
a condescending and encouraging
look. “You cannot but
know that I shall prove a most
excellent foil.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you ought not to talk
so,” remonstrated Rosalba, “for
you know Mr. H—— invariably
pronounces you to be his best
scholar.”</p>

<p>“Your performance will prove
how much his opinion is to be
depended upon,” returned Matilda
in the same graciously condescending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
tone; “and as I have
gained the right to call upon
you, I must beg leave to do so,
however it may turn out to my
own disadvantage.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing for you but
to play, Rosalba,” said Wharton,
who had stood by, listening to
the dispute; “so come, I will fix
the stool for you,” he added significantly
turning the music-seat
as he spoke, to raise it a little
higher; “you are one of the
lower class, you know, and we
therefore must try to elevate
you.” As he said this, his eye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
sought that of his friend Charles
Lisle, who stood near, and who
evidently understood it. Matilda,
too, observed his look, and
was as little at a loss to comprehend
its meaning, and her
bosom swelled almost to bursting.</p>

<p>Rosalba, finding that she was
expected to play, took her seat
at the instrument without any
further hesitation, and selecting
a beautiful, but far from difficult
piece of music, began it in an
easy and unaffected style. She
was far from having the execution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
of which Matilda was mistress,
but her touch was peculiarly
sweet, and being keenly
sensible of the charms of music
herself, she touched the feelings,
though she did not excite the
wonder of those who listened to
her. Edmund Wharton stood
by her side, ready to turn over
the leaves for her, and almost
as much absorbed by the tones
she drew forth as herself.</p>

<p>As she finished, and was about
to rise, the words “Oh don’t
leave the instrument yet!” “Do,
pray, let us have some more!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
“Oh, I wish you would play that
piece over again!” resounded
from those who were standing
about her, and Edmund said
with a look of exultation, “Miss
Hamilton must feel proud at
hearing her judgment so fully
confirmed by the general voice.”</p>

<p>“I was sure that Miss Pearson
knew how to take her hearers
by surprise,” returned Matilda.</p>

<p>“She is indeed quite an artist,”
said Edmund. “I had no
expectation of finding her so
much so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>“You are not yet aware how
great an artist she is,” replied
the jealous girl, whose splenetic
feelings had now got beyond her
control; “for she possesses the
art of not appearing to have
any.”</p>

<p>Rosalba turned round to Matilda
with a look of extreme
surprise, at this ungenerous and
unprovoked attack, and a flush
of indignation reddened her
cheek; but it disappeared the
next instant, and with a gentle
dignity that even Matilda could
not be blind to, she put her arm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
through that of a young lady
near her, and walked quietly to
the further end of the room.</p>

<p>Matilda felt the humiliation
that she had intended for another,
recoil upon herself; but
she tried to believe that it was
either not observed, or not understood
by Edmund, who, without
making any comment upon
what had passed, engaged himself
in adjusting the stool, and
fixing the music for other performers;
and as several songs
were sung, and sonatas played,
by various individuals, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
none of them had reached beyond
a school-girl’s style of performance,
Matilda had time to
compose her angry and mortified
feelings. She however very
soon relapsed again, for on Isabella’s
coming to say that she
was sent by several of the company
to beg that she would play
once more for them, she found
that she was allowed to screw
the stool down for herself,
though Edmund Wharton was
standing close to her at the time.
And even this was not all that
she had to encounter, for having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
either by accident or design, let
the piece of music drop from
her fingers, just as she was about
to place it on the desk, she was
permitted to stoop to pick it up
without any effort being made
by him to prevent her. This, we
are sorry to say, would not have
been very extraordinary with
many boys of Edward Wharton’s
age, but with him it was
an unequivocal mark of contempt;
for he had ever been so
remarkable for his polite attention
to those about him, that
when he failed in it, the circumstance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
could only be attributed
to design. If Matilda, however,
had entertained any doubt of
that being the case, it would
immediately have been dispelled
when Charles Lisle said in
a sort of whisper, but loud
enough for her to hear, “Why,
Wharton, how could you allow
Miss Hamilton to pick her music
up herself?”</p>

<p>“Because I thought it would
do her good to stoop a little,”
replied the other, laughing.—“She
will have to practise a
good deal before she becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
tolerable.” Not a word of this
was lost upon Matilda.</p>

<p>She even fancied that it was
intended she should hear it, and
she shook so with passion that
she had to turn over the music,
as if in search of something she
wanted, a considerable time before
she dared to trust her
trembling fingers to touch the
keys; and when she did, she
played with so unsteady a hand,
that she rose from the piano
when she had finished, still more
humbled and mortified.</p>

<p>At length the dancing was renewed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
and continued until all
seemed anxious to rest, when
Isabella proposed a game at
Magical Music, which was
agreed to by all hands; and
many a merry peal of laughter
resounded at the various mistakes
that were made.</p>

<p>Then there were the forfeits
to be worked for, and songs
were sung, pas seuls danced, and
various other penances performed,
for their recovery. At
length it was Edmund Wharton’s
lot to redeem his pledge,
by repeating some poetry. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
turning it over for some time in
his mind, he said, “I never was
a good hand at remembering
poetry, but a few lines have just
come into my head, of which,
however, I neither know the
author, nor am I sure I am quite
correct in the words: the sense
is the only thing I can answer
for, and will give it you, as well
as I can.”</p>

<p>He then repeated with much
distinctness, and with great effect,
the following well-known
lines:</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“What is the finest tincture of the skin,</div>
<div class="verse">To peace of mind and harmony within?</div>
<div class="verse">What the bright sparkling of the finest eye,</div>
<div class="verse">To the sweet soothings of a mild reply?</div>
<div class="verse">Can comeliness of form or shape or air</div>
<div class="verse">With comeliness of looks and words compare?</div>
<div class="verse">Those for a while may the affections gain,</div>
<div class="verse">But these, these only, can the heart retain.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Miss Hamilton’s carriage!”
called out a waiter, just as Edmund
had uttered the last
words; and Matilda rose, delighted
to be released from the purgatory
in which she had sat.
On arriving home, she found
only the old housekeeper sitting
up for her, and she hastened to
her chamber, glad to think she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
was at length to be alone. As
she entered the room, her own
figure, reflected at full length
in the large dressing-glass, met
her view; and she was startled
at the contrast between her
splendid attire and the mental
wretchedness displayed in her
countenance. Should the artist
we have employed to depict
her as she stood before her truthful
mirror, succeed in giving
expression to the feelings of
mortification, shame, and humiliation,
which rankled at that
moment in her breast, we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
sure that it cannot fail to present
a striking lesson to our
young readers.</p>

<p>How insufficient did she find
the wealth, splendour, and consequence
on which she had
hitherto prided herself, to restore
her self-respect, or blind
her to the superiority of one
whom she had treated with such
undeserved contempt!</p>

<p>“Oh, Rosalba!” she exclaimed
in a tone of deep feeling,
“what would I not give, to exchange
situations with you at
this moment! How much do I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
envy you the respect and affection
that all seem so anxious to
testify towards you! and how
happy should I be, could I learn
your art of winning it!”</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you how you
may gain it, Matilda?” asked a
voice behind her, that made her
start; and looking round, she
saw an old lady—a distant relative
of the family, who was, at
the time, on a visit to Mrs.
Hamilton, and, having heard
Matilda come in, and concluding
that she was much fatigued,
had come to offer her assistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
in undressing, and had by that
means become an unintentional
listener to the young girl’s soliloquy.
Never was offer of assistance
more à propos; for Matilda’s
proud spirit was humbled,
and in a right frame to receive
admonition. Throwing herself
therefore, on the neck of her
friend, she exclaimed, “Yes,
dear Aunt, advise, reprove, and
assist me, for I am wretched.”</p>

<p>“Reproof, my child,” said the
old lady, as she pressed the now
weeping girl to her bosom, “you
have little need of, for I understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
the kind of an evening
you have spent, and am persuaded
you are already sufficiently
punished. Neither do you need
any other assistance than that
of your own natural good sense.
Let me therefore advise you to
call it into action, and accustom
yourself to remember that the
advantages of birth and fortune
are altogether adventitious, and
though they may obtain for you
a cold and distant respect, they
never will gain the love of a
single being. But seek to learn
the law of love, and above all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
accustom yourself to practise
that divine rule of doing as you
would be done unto, and you
will soon find yourself surrounded
by affectionate hearts, and
feel that peace within, which no
external circumstances can supply.”</p>

<p>With many tears, Matilda
promised to lay this gentle admonition
to heart, and after a
little more conversation she laid
her head upon her pillow, with
a mind composed and tranquillized
by good resolutions, in
regard to her future conduct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“Did you ever see so altered
a girl as Matilda Hamilton is?”
said Edmund Wharton to his
friend Lisle, one day, about a
year after Isabella Ingersol’s
ball. “I declare she is grown
quite handsome.”</p>

<p>“She always was that,” returned
the other, “I never saw
a finer complexion, nor a more
regular set of features, in my
life.”</p>

<p>“That is true, and yet, heretofore,
I never could see any
beauty in her: her haughty, supercilious
manners destroyed it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
all. But she is become so gentle
and amiable, and treats every
one with such kind courtesy,
that it actually makes her look
beautiful; and I now take as
much pains to meet as I used
to take to avoid her.”</p>
